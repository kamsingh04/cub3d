Determines if the given angle is within the specified range for a 
unit circle quadrant (0 to PI for c == 'x', PI/2 to 3*PI/2 for c == 'y').


Checks for intersection based on the angle and adjusts the intersection point 
 accordingly.

 : Checks if there is a wall hit at coordinates (x, y) in the game map.


Calculates the horizontal intersection point and distance from the player's position 
 to the nearest wall.

 Calculates the vertical intersection point and distance from the player's position 
  to the nearest wall.

  Casts rays in a horizontal scan (field of view) and calculates intersections with walls,
   storing distances and flags for rendering.


   Raycasting, as implemented in the provided functions, is essential in several contexts
    where simulating 3D environments or performing spatial calculations is required. 
   Hereâ€™s why each function serves a crucial role in the raycasting process:

Unit Circle Check (unit_circle function):

Purpose: Determines if an angle is within a specified range for a unit circle quadrant.
Importance: In raycasting, angles are used to determine directions in a virtual 
2D space (representing a horizontal or vertical scan). Checking if an angle falls 
within specific ranges (quadrants) helps in accurately calculating ray directions and 
intersections with walls.
Intersection Check (inter_check function):

Purpose: Checks for intersections based on the angle and adjusts the intersection 
point accordingly.
Importance: When casting rays, it's crucial to detect when a ray intersects with 
a wall or reaches a boundary. This function ensures that the ray's path is accurately
 traced, taking into account the geometry of the grid-based map and the direction of the ray.
Wall Hit Check (wall_hit function):

Purpose: Determines if there is a wall hit at specific coordinates (x, y) in 
the game map.
Importance: Before rendering or calculating distances, it's essential to verify 
if the ray has encountered a wall. This function checks the map data to see if the 
current position (x, y) corresponds to a wall ('1' in the map data). This information
 is critical for accurately determining distances and rendering walls in the raycasting 
 process.
Horizontal Intersection Calculation (get_h_inter function):

Purpose: Calculates the horizontal intersection point and distance from the player's 
position to the nearest wall.
Importance: In raycasting, both horizontal and vertical intersections are calculated
 to determine the distances from the player's viewpoint to the nearest walls in these directions. This function ensures that the ray is traced horizontally, checking for intersections until it hits a wall or reaches the map boundaries.
Vertical Intersection Calculation (get_v_inter function):

Purpose: Calculates the vertical intersection point and distance from the player's
 position to the nearest wall.
Importance: Similar to get_h_inter, this function calculates intersections vertically.
 Together with horizontal intersections, it allows for accurate rendering of walls and 
 calculation of distances in the raycasting algorithm. Vertical intersections are
  necessary for covering the entire field of view of the player and ensuring all 
  potential walls are considered.
Ray Casting (cast_rays function):

Purpose: Casts rays in a horizontal scan (field of view), calculates intersections 
with walls, and stores distances and flags for rendering.
Importance: This function orchestrates the entire raycasting process. It iterates 
over each ray within the player's field of view, calculates both horizontal and 
vertical intersections, determines the closest wall for each ray, and prepares 
the data for rendering. The results of this function enable the creation of a 
first-person perspective view, where walls and objects are represented based on 
their distances from the player.
Why Do We Need Raycasting?
Raycasting is fundamental in various applications, including:

3D Rendering: Historically used in early first-person shooter (FPS) games like 
Wolfenstein 3D, where it simulated a 3D environment using 2D maps. Today, raycasting 
remains relevant in games and simulations for efficiently rendering 3D scenes.

Collision Detection: In simulations and games, raycasting is used to detect collisions 
between objects and the environment. It helps determine if a path (ray) intersects with
 any obstacles (walls), essential for physics engines and game mechanics.


Visibility Calculations: Raycasting is used to determine visibility between points in 3D
 space, helping optimize rendering by skipping unnecessary calculations for occluded objects.

Pathfinding and AI: In AI algorithms, raycasting is used for line-of-sight checks, pathfinding, 
and navigation through complex environments.

In summary, raycasting is a powerful technique for simulating vision, detecting obstacles, and 
rendering scenes in virtual environments. Each function in the provided code plays a critical 
role in implementing raycasting efficiently and accurately.
